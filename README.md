# Simple-Swift-Navigation
A straightforward Swift project demonstrating the basics of iOS app navigation using segues and data transfer between View Controller A and View Controller B. If you're new to iOS development or just looking for a quick refresher on navigation techniques, this repository is a great starting point.

# Introduction

In this project, we provide a clear example of how to navigate between two view controllers, ViewController A and ViewController B, using segues. Additionally, we demonstrate how to pass data from one view controller to another. Understanding this fundamental concept is essential when building iOS apps that involve multiple screens and data transfer.

# Usage

This repository serves as an educational resource for iOS developers looking to understand how to implement basic navigation and data transfer between view controllers. You can use this project as a reference when working on your own iOS applications.

Feel free to modify and extend the project to suit your specific needs or use it as a starting point for more complex navigation scenarios in your apps.
